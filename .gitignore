Here is a `.gitignore` file for your project. This file is essential for a professional repository because it tells Git to ignore files that shouldn't be tracked, such as large datasets, model artifacts, and local environment files.

```
# Python environment files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
.venv/
/htmlcov/
.tox/
.nox/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Data files (often too large for Git)
/data/
/predictions_test.csv

# Machine learning model artifacts
/models/
*.joblib
*.pkl
*.h5
*.keras
*.csv

# Streamlit-specific files
.streamlit/
